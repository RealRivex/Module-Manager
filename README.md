This is a ModManager for MCP-Reborn-Clients.

Eric Golde coded it in his YouTube Tutorial-Series for 1.8, 
and i made it compatible with Newer Versions.

Full Credit goes to Eric, as the System itself is made by him,
not by me. I only updated it.

Included is the HudManager stuff, the ModRender-Stuff, and 2 Examplemods, FPS and coords.

NOTE: The RenderUtils-Class is used to render the Rectangles
and Horizontal/Vertical Lines, as Minecraft iself has no methods for that anymore.
Please make sure to include it!

ANOTHER NOTE: Because it registers some stuff inside minecraft-code, you really need to watch Eric's video alongside adding this.
I cannot legally provide you the Minecraft-Code without getting jailed lol.


EDIT: thanks to a user, i saw that i forgot that i use 2 methods from a Minecraft internal-class, that i created myself. 
so you need to go into your class `AbstractGui`, and add those two methods:

NOTE: 1.16 is currently changed - will be added in a few time...
