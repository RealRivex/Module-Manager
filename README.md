This is a ModManager for MCP-Reborn-Clients.

Eric Golde coded it in his YouTube Tutorial-Series for 1.8, 
and i made it compatible with Newer Versions.

Full Credit goes to Eric, as the System itself is made by him,
not by me. I only updated it.

Included is the HudManager stuff, and 2 Examplemods, FPS and coords.

ANOTHER NOTE: Because it registers some stuff inside minecraft-code, you really need to watch Eric's video alongside adding this.
I cannot legally provide you the Minecraft-Code without getting jailed lol.

NOTE: 1.16 is currently changed - will be added in a few time...
