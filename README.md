This is a ModManager for MCP-Reborn-Clients.

Eric Golde coded it in his YouTube Tutorial-Series for 1.8, 
and i made it compatible with 1.16.5 (and eventually all 
other 1.16.x, but not tested at all!)

Full Credit goes to Eric, as the System itself is made by him,
not by me. I only updated it.

NOTE: The RenderUtils-Class is used to render the Rectangles
and Horizontal/Vertical Lines, as Minecraft iself has no methods for that anymore.
Please make sure to include it!
